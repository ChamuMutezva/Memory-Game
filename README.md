# Memory Game
The memory game is a pair matching game where the player
clicks on 2 cards, if they are the same they remain flipped
or else they return back to their original state. The game ends when all
cards are flipped open.
At the end of the game , information on time taken , moves and stars accumulated 
will be displayed.

I was inspired by Udacity to do the project as part of my course work.
Follow the link to play the game.
